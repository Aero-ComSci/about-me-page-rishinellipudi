    <h3>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>For my career I am interested in Computer Science and Finance. My dream colleges would be UC Berkeley, UCLA, UPENN Wharton or Oxford. I don't know specifically what job yet but I want to get a job in the field of Computer Science and/or Finance and make $500k-$1M or more. This is my career choice because I have a lot of interest in both and I started learning coding in 7th grade. I also have a lot of interest in stocks and have been following the market since I was 10 and I have started getting into it more in the last 6 months. I will achieve my goals by studying well and working hard in school. This will allow me to go to a good college which will land me a good job.</p>
    <h3>Strenghts, Qualities, Achievements and Aspirations</h1>
    <p>I am Friendly, Intelligent, Patient, Risk Taking, Hard working, Disciplined and Collaborative. These are all characteristics that are used in many careers
    including the one I want to go into. I like working with people because it is more fun than being by yourself and alone and I get more work done through collaboration. Being hard-working and disciplined are also an important part of me because success comes with discipline. An achievement is that I am on a vex robotics team and I have been to state level and national level tournaments. Some major aspirations for me would be to make millions of dollars, and to live a nice and happy life.
    <h3>Abilities and Work Skills</h3>
    <p>I am persistent and hard-working and when I want to do something I can get it done. From my past experiences I have learned that even though it is not always possible, you should try to do things that you like whether it is deciding between classes in school or deciding on a job. I am also good with math and computers. I have experience with coding and I know a good amount of python and I have also coded games in Pygame. I also do robotics and I can use power tools and cut metal and build things with metal parts and I can code a little bit in c++. </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, I am a 9th grade student with good qualities and skills and I want a job in the field of CS and Finance.
    Thank you for reading my about me.</p>
